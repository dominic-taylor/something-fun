# something-fun

I decided to make my fun-thing quite simple. The concept is quite basic, there are three buttons
that a user will press based their mood. Each of the buttons will link to an image or video depending
on how they are feeling i.e, 
What is your mood,(happy , sad, angry) 
sad == silly thing, angry == happy thing, happy == random video?

My minimal functionalty would be to have the buttons link to image or video and they all work. I would also like 
to have one of the buttons link to a random youtube video, but we'll see how hard it is to get on first. I may have  
few vides linnked and have a random one show up. This could be one fo my functions. 
Possible allow users to add to the video collections? Will have to see how that works regarding saving data.
A quick serch shows it is not so straight forward to link to random youtube links, but you can make a list of links
which could be taken from. 
It would be cool if the title changed colours like a mood ring. 


Having difficulty making the click embed or change to a youtube video. I could use gifs instead.
